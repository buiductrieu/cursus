Many people nowadays do not have time to go to live courses due to various reasons. Therefore, this project is proposed to solve the learning problem of users as well as create more jobs for instructors.

This is a course management project where students can register for their desired courses and study online. Upon completion of the course, the system will award certificates to the students. Instructors can upload their courses and get paid based on the number of students enrolling.
